# Rustic

A simple static site generator in Rust.

Rustic take Markdown and converts it into static HTML pages using Rust. I used this project as a Rust refresher.

### Cargo Used

- anyhow
- clap
- fs_extra
- gray_matter
- pulldown-cmark
- serde
- tera
- walkdir

Markdown is placed in the "content" folder and output in the public folder as HTML.
