## Why Rust is a Great Choice

Rust's ownership model is a game-changer for systems programming. It prevents entire classes of bugs at compile time.

1. **Memory Safety**: No null pointer dereferences, no data races.
2. **Performance**: Compiles to native code with performance comparable to C/C++.
3. **Concurrency**: Fearless concurrency is built right into the language.
